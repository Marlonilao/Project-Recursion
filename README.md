# Project-Recursion

This project explores recursion by tackling two classic problems: Fibonacci Sequence and Merge Sort.
It demonstrates how recursion can break down complex problems into smaller steps, making the logic easier to follow.
The goal is to practice thinking recursively and understand how algorithms like Fibonacci and Merge Sort work behind the scenes.
